Great investing often comes down to combining lots of simple things that each give you a small improvement. In this chapter, we're going to learn about one of these simple things, investing regularly.

The ups and downs of markets can seem exciting in some moments and scary in others. The alternative to investing regularly is to hold off purchasing more investments during these scary times until you believe the market has reached a bottom. You then purchase at a cheap price and watch your investment increase in value. To pull this off, you will need to have perfect market timing.

It turns out, no matter the market condition, investing regularly gives you a small advantage. Let's explore the idea of perfectly timing the market and see what we get.

# Pretend perfect market timing

Let's play a game. We're going to trade two different investment strategies. The first one we'll call **Invest Monthly** where we will invest in the S&P 500 every single month. The second one we'll call **Perfect Timing**. This strategy will be setup for success. We can look into the future! We will only buy more share in the S&P 500 when the market has reached a bottom. This means that the Perfect Timing strategy can time the market perfectly.

We'll play this game from January 1900 all the way until September 2020. This time period ensures we cover many different kinds of economic situations from depressions (1930s) to currency devaluation (1970s) and pandemics (2020s). See below for the full 120 year history of S&P prices.

We'll assume that every month, we'll have $1 to invest in the market from our day job. This will be $1 in January 1900 and will be adjusted for inflation every month. We'll also be receiving an income from our investments in the form of dividends.

[DOUBLE CHART: value of $1 and S&P dividends per share]

Here are the investment strategies:

* **Invest Monthly** - Every month, take our income (monthly income from job + dividends) and buy shares in the S&P 500 index.

* **Perfect Timing** - Every month, collect our income (monthly income from job + dividends) and hold it. Only buy shares when the market has reached the lowest point between two consecutive market highs. We can only do this if we're able to have perfect knowledge about the future. Obviously, we cannot do this in real life, but this is just a game!

In our experiment period of 1900 to 2020 there are X months, so the Invest Monthly strategy will purchase shares int the S&P 500 X times. There are X number of market bottoms highlighted below. So there are X times the Perfect Timing strategy purchases shares.

Let's see what happens when we play through these investment strategies.
